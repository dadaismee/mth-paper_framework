## Conceptual framework

### Intrdocution
Our conceptual framework consists of three major parts: 

This is very thoughtful sentence, indeed. 

- digital placemaking
- participatory design and co-creation of the design tools
- data storytelling

Combining these tools provides an epistemological device that helps to co-design not only sustainable, but regenerative nature-based solutions. 

1. Placemaking
2. *Digital inclusion â€” ontological side and user-centered one?*
3. Analog tools like boards and QR-codes are **not sufficient to understand and meaningfully represent** the more-than-human life
4. This is why we need digital placemaking tools
5. Data stories: best of both worlds (meaningful representation and digital inclusion by objective measurement)
6. The co-creation process
7. Collaborative visualization design (Cay, Nagel, and Yantac 2020)
8. Non-human persona as a tool for inclusive representation
