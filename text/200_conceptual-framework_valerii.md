## Conceptual framework

1. **What the framework includes:**
   - More-than-human agency
   - placemaking practices (as a part of urban governance)
   - participatory design 
   - data storytelling

2. Why bother about **more-than-human** in urban governance (regenerative design) 
   - Sustainability is insufficient — **WHY?** 
   - What is wrong with human-centeredness  
     1. [@sheikh2023] 
     2. data capitalism
   
3. How to address the under-representedness of the nature
   1. **Digital inclusion** [@sheikh2023]
   2. Representation of MTH life in the urban area as means for humans to extract meaning and relevance
   3. What else is needed to extract meaning and relevance?
   
4. **Collectively constructed narratives** about natural agents
   1. If we use data to represent MTH in a meaningful way, it requires relatable way of representation
   2. Relatable for whom? And how to figure out what is relatable?
   3. Participatory design as a tool for co-construction of narratives about natural agents
5. Co-construction of data-backed narratives about natural agents as a tool for **placemaking**  
   1. Why placemaking and nothing else
6. How to make it work (tie to methodology)
***

6. Placemaking
7. *Digital inclusion — ontological side and user-centered one?*
8. Analog tools like boards and QR-codes are **not sufficient to understand and meaningfully represent** the more-than-human life
9.  This is why we need digital placemaking tools
10. Data stories: best of both worlds (meaningful representation and digital inclusion by objective measurement)
11. The co-creation process
12. Collaborative visualization design (Cay, Nagel, and Yantac 2020)
13. Non-human persona as a tool for inclusive representation
