1. Why bother about **more-than-human** in urban governance (regenerative design) 
   - Sustainability is insufficient â€” **WHY?** 
     - Conserving the status quo
     1. [Limits to growth](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html)

     1. [@sheikh2023] 
     2. data capitalism
   
2. How to address the under-representedness of the nature
   1. **Digital inclusion** [@sheikh2023]
   2. Representation of MTH life in the urban area as means for humans to extract meaning and relevance
   3. What else is needed to extract meaning and relevance?
   
3. **Collectively constructed narratives** about natural agents
   1. If we use data to represent MTH in a meaningful way, it requires relatable way of representation
   2. Relatable for whom? And how to figure out what is relatable?
   3. Participatory design as a tool for co-construction of narratives about natural agents
4. Co-construction of data-backed narratives about natural agents as a tool for **placemaking**  
   1. Why placemaking and nothing else
5. How to make it work (tie to methodology)
